# mij.orac

My patches or converted patches for Mark Harris' Orac (https://github.com/TheTechnobear/Orac) to run on the Organelle.

## F-tapeecho / bapch's "RE-150 Space Echo Simulation"

Converted from: https://github.com/bapch/RE-Tape-Echo

## S-spacekittens / callmesam's "Do space kittens dream of intergalactic yarn?"

Converted from: https://patchstorage.com/do-space-kittens-dream-of-intergalactic-yarn/
But without the effects, as this would make it too heavy.

## U-chorder / my own chord generation module

This patch creates chords. Sets the chord in the settings with knobs, advances to next note based on measure or on incoming note (see settings, last page)

## S-lofipiano / Sean Earl Beard's Lo-Fi Poly Piano. based on Henrik's Piano patch

Converted from: https://patchstorage.com/lo-fi-poly-piano/ which uses https://patchstorage.com/piano/

It's lo-fi piano samples

## S-warblyukelele / Sean Earl Beard's Warbly Ukelele.

Converted from: https://patchstorage.com/warbly-ukelele/

Very noisy lo-fi ukelele samples. Also fixed a note which was not the right pitch.

## S-tapesynth / fuurthur's Tape Synth

Converted from: https://patchstorage.com/tape-synth/

Great mellotron-like patch. Fixed some bugs and made it polyphonic.
