# mij.orac

My patches or converted patches for Mark Harris' Orac (https://github.com/TheTechnobear/Orac) to run on the Organelle.

## F-tapeecho / bapch's "RE-150 Space Echo Simulation"

Converted from: https://github.com/bapch/RE-Tape-Echo

## S-spacekittens / callmesam's "Do space kittens dream of intergalactic yarn?"

Converted from: https://patchstorage.com/do-space-kittens-dream-of-intergalactic-yarn/
But without the effects, as this would make it too heavy.

## U-chorder / my own chord generation module

This patch creates chords.
